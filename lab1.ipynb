    "\n",
    "### 2. Set up a tool for virtual environments\n",
    "Virtual environments are a great way to separate your package dependencies and even your Python versions. I highly recommend miniconda (called 'conda') -- since it is not limited to Python; you can even set up an R environment with conda. Alternatives are virtualenv and pipenv. If you already work with virtual environments, you can skip this step. Otherwise\n",
    "1. install miniconda; now that you have some basic command line skills, it's probably easiest to use the Quick Command Line Install (just choose your operating system and follow the instructions)\n",

It helps you to track your own changes on a project and to collaborate effectively with your teams. Generally, this part of the work flow will consist of creating a new repo or cloning an existing one from Github. The steps are\n",
    "1. install git (run `git --version` to check if you already have it installed)\n",
    "2. to clone an existing repository, such as the one for these labs, run `git clone https://github.com/lenafm/data_structures_and_algorithms_2024.git` and then move into the new directory that this creates\n",

    "### 4. Set up Jupyter notebooks\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks are a great way for quick experimentation with code, to present code, or to create data science work flows. The final functions and classes (and testing) that you write for a project should **not** sit in Jupyter notebook. Those should be written in `.py` files (aka Python modules) or, even better, in Python packages. One best-practice tip: start your code experiments in a Jupyter notebook and once you find yourself using some functions/classes repeatedly or think you might need them in other notebooks, migrate them into Python modules (and later to a package). To run this Jupyter notebook, follow these steps:\n",
    "1. make sure the `dsa` environment you created in step 2 is activated\n",
    "2. install jupyter into this environment using the `pip install jupyter` command (installing something *into* an environment just means that you need to run the installation command after having activated the environment)\n",
    "3. now move into the directory for the DS&A repository that you cloned in step 3 (called `data_structures_and_algorithms_2024`).\n",
    "4. run `jupyter notebook`; this will start your default browser (or open a new tab) and you should now see a folder structure that includes the Jupyter notebook file `lab1.ipynb`\n",
    "5. click on `lab1.ipynb` to run it and familiarise yourself with the keyboard shortcuts for running cells, creating new cells (above and below the current cell), and removing cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Set up your IDE\n",
    "After step 4., you can now write code in Jupyter notebooks. For the type of coding necessary for larger (and collaborative) projects, you'll also need an IDE (integrated development environment), such as PyCharm. This is where you'll write classes, functions, helper functions, tests etc. I recommend PyCharm, because it has many 'intelligent code' features such as code prediction, readability, error detection, easy refactoring, and because it provides debugging tools.\n",
    "1. install PyCharm\n",
    "2. create a new PyCharm project for the DS&A labs: <br>\n",
    "    i. on the `New Project` screen, set the `Location` path to the path to the `data_structures_and_algorithms_2024` directory <br>\n",
    "    ii. change the radio button from `New encironment using ...` to `Previously configured interpreter` <br>\n",
    "    iii. in the `Interpreter` dropdown menu, choose the Python installation that is within the `dsa` conda environment you created above<br>\n",
